title: "Questions to ask technical interviewers"
---

I recently finished several months of interviewing at various tech companies
across the world (spoiler: I've accepted an offer from [???](???)).

I find it difficult to come up on the spot with good questions to ask. I scoured the internet for lists and wrote down a lot. In the end, I kept asking the same questions -- ones that help most with decision making -- over and over again.

[Here's my list.](https://xkcd.com/927/)

**To engineers:**

Q: Tell me about a project you're particularly proud of.

> TODO

**To technical/engineering managers:**

Q: What are the expected responsibilities within the first 3-6 months?

> TODO

Q: How do you measure success of individual contributors?

> TODO

Q: Where do you see yourself in 2-3 years?  

> I don't like putting people on the spot. That said, this is one of my favourite questions to ask. It's reassuring to hear passionate answers about future goals from managers you'd be working for if you're expecting a certain level of support for your own goals from them.

Q: What do you think will be the biggest challenge for you in the coming months?

> TODO
