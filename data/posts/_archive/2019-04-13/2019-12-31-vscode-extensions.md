### Git Lens

[Marketplace Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)

**Q: What does it do?**
> A: Adds Git functionality like live blame (hover to view the author of a particular line),
easy navigation of file history, and visualization of changes.

**Q: Why?**
> A: Built-in Git support is lacking in features and it can be more productive to use an extension rather
than to switch applications or to rely solely on the Git CLI, especially for beginners.

**Q: What does it do?**

### ESLint

[Marketplace Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

**Q: What does it do?**
> A: Integrates [ESLint](https://eslint.org) into VS Code and providing inline hints. It will automatically
use the ESLint configuration of the project.

**Q: Why?**
> A: Linters help maintain code quality and consistency. Integration into the editor instead of running
it explicitly on the command line helps catch mistakes as they happen.

### EditorConfig

[Marketplace Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)

**Q: What does it do?**
> A: Integrates the [.editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) format into VS Code and automatically
formats files (e.g. indent sizing and trailing newlines) on save.

**Q: Why?**
> A: Consistent coding style within a project reduces cognitive load due to stylistic differences.
`.editorconfig` helps maintain a coding style across editors and IDEs (provided they have support for it).

PDF to some business-people.
